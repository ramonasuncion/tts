# secrets.yaml.example — copy to src/private/secrets.yaml and edit values
# DO NOT commit your secrets file. This example is safe to keep in the repo.
#
# Usage:
#  cp src/private/secrets.yaml.example src/private/secrets.yaml
#  edit src/private/secrets.yaml and fill in secrets (client ids, secrets, keys)
#
# Notes about automatic generation:
# - If `session_secret` or `jwt_secret` is missing, the app's helpers will
#   generate them and write them into the chosen secrets file on first run.
# - If `auth.enabled` is true and role API keys are missing, the app will
#   generate keys (except for "mod") and write them into the secrets file,
#   printing any newly-created keys to stdout. Save them somewhere secure.
# - The app reads/writes the YAML structure. It deserializes the file, updates
#   the Python dict, and then re-writes the YAML. It does not simply append
#   raw YAML text, so comments may be dropped when the app writes the file.

# OAuth provider credentials (put provider creds here)
# Example: Twitch
oauth:
  twitch:
    # Set these values to your Twitch app credentials
    client_id: "your_twitch_client_id"
    client_secret: "your_twitch_client_secret"
    # Redirect URI should match what's configured in the provider app
    # For local testing use: http://localhost:8000/api/auth/callback
    redirect_uri: "https://yourhost/api/auth/callback"

  # mappings: map provider ids/usernames to roles
  mappings:
    twitch:
      # numeric Twitch id -> role (preferred)
      "12345678": "admin"
      # username (case-insensitive) -> role
      "someusername": "mod"

########################################
# Role API keys (optional). If auth.enabled is true, the server will
# generate missing keys and write them here. You may paste pre-generated
# keys instead if you want to control them.
keys:
  admin: ""  # paste or leave empty to auto-generate
  tts: ""
  push: ""
  pull: ""

########################################
# Optional manual secrets (if you want to pre-seed them instead of letting
# the app generate them automatically):
# session_secret: "<long-random-string>"
# jwt_secret: "<long-random-string>"

########################################
# Other arbitrary notes you might want to keep locally (these will be
# preserved in this example but not necessarily preserved if the app
# rewrites the file since the app writes a generated YAML from the dict):
# note: "Keep this file private"
